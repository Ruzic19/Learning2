h1 {
    font-size: 20px;
}

.container {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    border: 1px black solid;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
}

.container > div {
    border: 1px solid black;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
    padding: 0 20px;
    background-color: lightcoral;
}

@media  (min-width: 600px) and (max-width: 1200px) {
    h1 {
        font-size: 36px;
    }

    .container > div {
